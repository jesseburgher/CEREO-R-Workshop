# CEREO-R-Workshop: Reproducible REsearch Techniques in R November 16th, 2020

Repository for data analysis, scripts, and figures workshop.

##Goals for this Workshop
- Get more familiar with R and research techniques in general.
- Familiarize myself with workflows and ways to ensure my coding and analysis is easily followable and shareable.
- Gain more knowledge of the tidyverse.


# Here we practice making changes thenb do the process, ADD, COMMITT, PUSH,
This whole process is useful for keeping track of your changes and track work. 
Generally, workflow with Git would be as follows
Git workflow: 
- ‘git pull’ syncs us up with the repository online
- Make changes
- ‘git add’ to add files that we want to record
- ‘git commit -m “message”’
- 'git push'

TRY #3 for Fun

Running Notes now that I will update 
#When to Commit?
-Committing makes sense when breaking up specific tasks, it is personal preference. Can do end of work day, or specific tasks, or more often.
